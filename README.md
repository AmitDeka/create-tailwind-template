## Quick Overview

```bash
  npx create-tailwind-template my-project
  cd my-project
  npm start
```

After typing the last command it will server the website in http://localhost:5000/ to see your app.

## Create an website

You’ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). We recommend using the latest LTS version.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```
npx create-tailwind-template my-project
```

(npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see instructions for older npm versions)

### npm

```
npm init tailwind-template my-project
```

npm init <initializer> is available in npm 6+
